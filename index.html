<h1>What can you do with waste</h1>
<p>Instead of throwing waste you can do tons of things with waste like if you are throwing a ladder then instead of throwing it you can make it into a bookshelf.
<p>There are tons tons of things that you can do with plastic bottles like create a broom with it or create a flower pot with it or even create wrist bands that you can wear. Some things like paper you can't really make things much out of that so instead oof throwing paper in the rubbish bin, throw it in the recycling bin.</p>
<h3>Your old clothes (What can you do with it?)</h3>
<p>Some people might have some old clothes that you didn't use and you want to throw it away. Then instead of throwing it away you can just give to poor people on the streets or donate it to charities which collect clothes, charities like crossroads in HK or any other charity you know then just contact them and tell them that you are donating something then 99.99% they will want your old clothes.
<h3>Create big things out of it</h3>
<p>If you go to beaches then you will see tons of plastic bags over there and with the plastic bag you can create big things like a big monster out of it and that will make people feel how bad is waste or it can also make people thing of how much things they have wasted.</p>
